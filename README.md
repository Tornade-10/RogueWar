# RogueWar

# For the future
This is my school project for roguelike project, the generation of the map is made by a Wave Function Collapsed (that is a bit broken right now).

I want to add buldings and a HQ for the player and the ennemie(s), the goal will be to build units, controll units to kill the enemies units and destroy their HQ

for now there is no player but once I start doing it I want a "Selector" that can :
-  Move around tile by tile
-  Select buldings/units
-  see informations of units/building while hover
-  control units
-  produce units with buildings

# The project

The scene is "WaveFunctionCollapsed" that is in the follder "Scenes" (don't mind the other scenes)

for comands right now, in the editor there is "step" and "clear" in the Object "generator"
you can olso hit "play" to have a full simulation
